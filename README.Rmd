Compare Different Methods of Metagenomic Differential Abundance Analysis (DAA)

## Description
A healthy microbiome is an essential component of an individual's health. In fact, studies have shown a correlation between differences in microbiota composition and various diseases (Vijay and Valdes 2022). As a result, it is not difficult to understand the need for software tools to understand how the microbiome changes between conditions. This has, however, proven to be a difficult task (Weiss et al. 2017), resulting in the development of several packages in order to facilitate metagenomic differential abundance analysis (DAA). However, a recent study has found that the results of these methods have been very inconsistent and the performance of each method varies with each dataset (Nearing et al. 2022), suggesting that a consensus approach might be taken before a robust method is found. Thus, this becomes a exhaustive task, especially when multiple conditions are to be tested.   

germseq is a package that implements this suggestion by taking three commonly used methods of DAA (DESeq2, ANCOM-BC, ALDEx2) and streamlining the analysis process by executing and comparing the results of these methods. Through its analysis and visualization functions, individuals are therefore able to quickly evaluate the sensitivity of each method as well as the robustness of the results. 

The germseq package was developed using R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31), Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) and Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS.

## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("karenliu5/germseq", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("germseq")
```

## Overview
``` r
ls("package:germseq")
data(package = "germseq")
```

germseq provides three functions to evaluate the performance of DESeq2, ANCOM-BC, and ALDEx2:

* The `compare_DAA_methods` and `compare_DAA_methods_2` functions 
* The `visualize_performances`
* The `visualize_overlap`

For a tutorial of the package, please refer to the following vignette:
``` r
browseVignettes("germseq")
```
